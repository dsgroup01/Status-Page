# Status-Page
![screenshot](https://status.trucksbook.eu/img/screenshot.png)

Very simple server status page written in PHP that can run on **PHP 5.3+** - even on **shared webhosting**. Because why waste your money on another server (or host on a server that you might want to do maintenance on), when you can use cheap webhosting?

## How do I install this thing?
Simply put the files on your server and access it from your browser. There will be a simple install dialog waiting for you.

### Why does this project exist?
It was written as a school project where we had to create a website. I went with this because I found the lack of good looking, easy to install and use status page rather weird. Therefore my goal (as stated above) was to create a simplistic status page that could run almost anywhere. The code is not the nicest or cleanest and it definitely doesn't have that many features, but hey, it works!

### I want feature XY!
You can write an issue and I will try to take a look when I get some time *OR* you can actually make a fork as the code it GNU licensed. Pull requests are most welcome!
